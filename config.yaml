a: 200.0 # parameter a of the Z/R relationship Standard value according to Marshall-Palmer is a=200
b: 1.6 # parameter b of the Z/R relationship Standard value according to Marshall-Palmer is b=1.6
rainy_pxl_threshold: 0.05 # threshold for determining whether the pixel of radar picture is rainy or not (mm of rain per capture interval)
rainy_img_threshold: 0.2 # threshold for determining whether the radar picture is rainy or not (percentage of rainy pixels in image)
input_length: 6 # how many images we want to base our prediction on
target_length: 6 # how many images we want to forecast into future
